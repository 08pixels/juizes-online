### [How many are smaller than me II?]

This is a hard version of [How many are smaller than me?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56a1c074f87bc2201200002e). If you have troubles solving this one, have a look at the easier kata first.

Write
```js
function smaller(arr)
```
that given an array `arr`, you have to return the amount of numbers that are smaller than `arr[i] `to the right.

For example:
```js
smaller([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) === [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
smaller([1, 2, 0]) === [1, 1, 0]
```
