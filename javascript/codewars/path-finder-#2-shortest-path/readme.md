### [Path Finder #2: shortest path](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57658bfa28ed87ecfa00058a/javascript)  

**Task**

You are at position `[0, 0]` in maze NxN and you can **only** move in one of the four cardinal directions (i.e. North, East, South, West). Return the minimal number of steps to exit position `[N-1, N-1]` if it is possible to reach the exit from the starting position. Otherwise, return false.

Empty positions are marked `.`. Walls are marked `W`. Start and exit positions are guaranteed to be empty in all test cases.
